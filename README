#simple-shell

This is a Linux shell with bash-like functionality. To run a shell command, the user specifies the name of the command and the
three file descriptors to be used as standard input, standard output, and standard error. This allows you to create a complex
schedule of commands, unlike bash, where you can only run a linear schedule of commands.
